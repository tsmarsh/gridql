### Security Vulnerability Response

Once the report is received, the following actions will be taken:

- I will confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report and start investigating the issue immediately.

## General Security Information

GridQL is a JavaScript library designed to support web applications, not an actual web application. This distinction is important as it may impact the security context and the nature of potential vulnerabilities.

## Reminder

This project is maintained by an individual. While efforts are made to ensure robust security, the resources for testing and patching are limited compared to larger projects.

If this project is important to you or your business, I would love PRs. 

## More Information

For any further information about the security in GridQL, please open a GitHub issue or check existing discussions in the issues section.
